# Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Racing

In this Notebook I am doing a quick implementation of the Learning-Based Model Predictive Control framework, proposed by Kabzan et.al. (2019). The paper that introduces this algorithm can be found through the following link.

I am doing this implementation purely to understand the concept as detailed as possible in preperation for an interview for a master's thesis.
All credit for the development of this framework goes to Kabzan et.al..
